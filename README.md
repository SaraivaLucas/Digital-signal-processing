# Digital-signal-processing
At this repository I'll create my own examples about digital signal processing with due theoretical background creating my owns expamples.

----------

## [Discrete Time Fourier Transform (DTFT) - Matlab](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/SaraivaLucas/Digital-signal-processing/blob/master/Trabalho%201/Trabalho%20DTFT.ipynb)
The DTFT is unaplicable by a code. But we can compute the transform by hands-on activities.

## [Computational Simulation - Discrete Time Signals and Systems](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/SaraivaLucas/Digital-signal-processing/blob/master/Trabalho%202/Trabalho%20Rxx.ipynb)
Here, we will estimate the autocorrelation of a AWGN (Gausian Noise) which has mean $\mi=0$ and variance $\sigma ^{2}=0.5$. As long as we increase the numbers of samples, the correlation tends to a standard, which is the truely autocorrelation of an AWGN. It means that the only information that the Rxx of a signal has is it's power (Rxx(n=0)), tending to zero along it's length.
